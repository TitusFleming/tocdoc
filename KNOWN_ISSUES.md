- **Workaround**: Refresh page to see new data
- **Fix Timeline**: Alpha version

### Data Entry
**Issue**: Patient data must be entered manually
- **Status**: No hospital EMR integration yet
- **Workaround**: Use Admin Panel for batch patient creation
- **Fix Timeline**: Alpha/Beta versions

**Issue**: No automated admission/discharge feeds
- **Status**: Designed for hospital integration but not implemented
- **Workaround**: Manual entry by hospital admin users
- **Fix Timeline**: Beta version

### UI/UX Minor Issues

- **Fix Timeline**: Alpha version

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Considerations

### Database
**Note**: Uses PostgreSQL locally - customer needs to set this up
- **Setup Required**: Customer must install PostgreSQL
- **Migration**: Database schema changes may require re-seeding
- **Backup**: No automated backup system yet

### Authentication
**Note**: Requires Clerk account setup
- **Dependency**: Customer needs to create free Clerk account
- **Configuration**: Must configure Clerk keys in environment variables
- **Session**: Sessions expire based on Clerk settings (default 7 days)

### Performance
**Note**: Optimized for small datasets (< 1000 patients)
- **Current Capacity**: Works well with hundreds of patients
- **Scaling**: Database indexing may need optimization for larger datasets
- **Monitoring**: No performance monitoring implemented yet

## üîí Security Notes

### HIPAA Compliance
**Ready**: Core HIPAA requirements implemented
- ‚úÖ Data encryption at rest and in transit
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control
- ‚úÖ 30-day data retention policy
- ‚úÖ Secure authentication

**Not Yet Implemented**:
- üî≤ Audit logging (framework ready)
- üî≤ Multi-factor authentication (Clerk supports this)
- üî≤ Penetration testing
- üî≤ Business Associate Agreements

### Data Handling
**Safe**: No PHI in notifications (HIPAA compliant)
**Safe**: Role-based data filtering prevents unauthorized access
**Note**: Data stored locally on customer infrastructure

2. **Advanced Analytics**: Medicare Advantage tracking dashboards
3. **Workflow Automation**: Automated follow-up reminders
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interface
5. **Reporting Engine**: Compliance and utilization reports

### Lower Priority (Production - 16+ weeks)
1. **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Support multiple hospital systems
2. **HL7/FHIR Integration**: Healthcare data standards
3. **Native Mobile Apps**: iOS/Android applications
4. **Enterprise Security**: SSO, advanced authentication
5. **Advanced Workflow**: Custom care coordination workflows

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup Issues

### Common Problems & Solutions

**Problem**: Clerk keys not working
- **Solution**: Verify keys are copied correctly from Clerk dashboard
- **Check**: Make sure you're using the correct environment (test vs. production)

**Problem**: Database connection failed
- **Solution**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and connection string is correct
- **Check**: Database name, username, password, host, and port

**Problem**: Build errors with TypeScript
- **Solution**: Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- **Check**: Node.js version should be 18 or higher

**Problem**: Roles not working correctly
- **Solution**: Complete the onboarding process after sign-up
- **Check**: User role is set in database (can verify via Prisma Studio)

**Problem**: Pages not loading after authentication
- **Solution**: Check that middleware.ts is properly configured
- **Check**: Clerk environment variables are set correctly
